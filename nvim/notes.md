## Target

## Wishlist

- [x] replace/configure tms better (on mac)
- [x] advanced grep with filename filtering
- [ ] Merge kickstart with current 
  - [ ] Test out go debugger in kickstarter
- [ ] Smooth notes system
- [x] Set up incremental selection
- [ ] Set "log level" in omnisharp to Information to show logs maybe?
- [ ] treesitter highlighting for gotmpl
  - https://github.com/LunarVim/breadcrumbs.nvim
- [ ] azure link
- [ ] fix folding
  - [ ] no folds in finder
  - [ ] doesn't reset on file reentry
- [ ] Fancy nested notes system


## TODO
- [ ] practice merge conflict resolution
  - [ ] lazygit?
- [ ] Understand filetype indent stuff: `help filetype.txt`
  - in the meantime, just use :Sleuth to match current file

## Reference
- C# LSP
  - Keep eye on [issue for not decompiling type defs](https://github.com/Hoffs/omnisharp-extended-lsp.nvim/issues/26)
    - decompiling yields different "file name" for go-to-definition and go-to-type-definition. Related?


## Process

- Upon each review:
  - Delete all completed tasks
  - Delete all irrelevant tasks
